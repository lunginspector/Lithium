>[!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to supervise your device before using this tool. You can do it with [this guide.](https://gist.github.com/lunginspector/cfd1e1f1cd450ec4dcf99e311684b9ab)

### How does it work?
* Lithium works by taking advantage of profiles meant for devices that are supervised. For more information on these profiles, visit [Apple's Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation)
* These profiles allow us to enable features that are not usually [accessible](https://github.com/lunginspector/Accessible) to your device. These profiles have been tested and are safe to use (though if anything unexpected does happen, you can easily remove the profile).

### Tested Devices
* iPhone 13 Pro, iOS 18.0.1
* iPhone 11 Pro, iOS 18.0.1
* iPhone 12 mini, iOS 17.5.1
